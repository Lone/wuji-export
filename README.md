# Wudi Export

> Thanks [@utom](https://github.com/utom) for his great work, `Sketch Measure` is really a life saver when I share design specifications to co-workers.
> But it lack of maintenance in recent year, that's why I start this project.

Wudi Export is a re-implemention of `Sketch Measure` with TypeScript, uses Sketch JavaScript API. 

It aims to be:

1. More stable, not likely to break down after Sketch update.
1. Easy to maintain.

## Improvements

Improvements that users can recognize:

1. Fully works with lastest version of Sketch (v66).
1. The latest `Tint` feature support.
1. Easily resize markers, without concerns to break them. (The `resizing constrain` feature).
1. Export directly with `Anima stacks` activated.
1. Customize the order of exported artboards.
1. Better display of text fragments.
1. Re-organize functions and panels.

## Notice

If you encounter problems managing (toggle hidden/locked, remove, and export) markers created by Sketch Measure, run the menu `Plugin - Wudi Export - Help - Rename Old Markers`.
